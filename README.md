The tweak was not developed by me. I just reuploaded it...


For rootless Jailbreaks the doesn’t support ElleKit use this file
●	run.er.wormctrl_1.1.0_rootless_CydiaSubstrate_Substitute
For majority of Jailbreaks like Dopamine and Pelare1n use this file
●	run.er.wormctrl_1.1.0_rootless_Ellekit

Note: if any of these tweaks are not working properly or causing crashing and springboard issues, consider installing Legacy arm64e Support. Only install this if you need it.
